The RT-Thread RISC-V course provides an opportunity for users to gain insight into the architectural principles underpinning RT-Thread, as well as the extent of its compatibility with RISC-V. The course will introduce the process of porting RT-Thread for RISC-V chips and the development of RT-Thread applications on RISC-V chips. This chapter will present a detailed overview of the architecture of RT-Thread, including the RT-Thread kernel, device drivers, components, software packages, and the RT-Thread documentation centre and forum. Developers can access the documentation centre to learn about RT-Thread and engage with the community forum to pose questions and share their development experiences.
