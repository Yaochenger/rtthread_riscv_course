### Chapter Description

This chapter describes the regular startup flow of RISC-V microcontrollers and the functions that need to be implemented to adapt RT-Thread for RISC-V microcontrollers. At the same time, it will introduce the implementation process of the above ported functions in the RISC-V architecture in detail, including switching between interrupts and threads, switching between threads, switching interrupts, and other function implementations.

Through the study of this chapter you will master the following contents:

- RISC-V MCU routine startup process
- RT-Thread context switch API implementation
- How to adapt RT-Thread for RISC-V MCUs.
