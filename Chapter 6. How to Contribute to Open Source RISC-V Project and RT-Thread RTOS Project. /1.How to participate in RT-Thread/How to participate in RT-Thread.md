### How to participate in RT-Thread

RT-Thread, as an open source RTOS, has a lot of enthusiasts participating in it, and has been constantly updating and iterating. Usually we may find bugs in the code when we are developing, and at this time, if we find a problem but don't find a suitable solution, we can submit the found problem to [issue option](https:// github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/issues), an example is as follows:

We can create a new issue by clicking on the `New issue` option, and the community developers will be involved in discussing and resolving the issue.

At this time, if we find the problem and find a suitable solution, we can commit pr to the mainline repository, if you are a newbie, you can check out [how to commit code to gitla](https://www.rt-thread.io/document/site/development-guide/github/ github/#contribution-process_1).

Code submitted to gitlab is reviewed daily by a dedicated person.

If we encounter problems during the development process, we can raise our questions by posting them in [forum](https://club.rt-thread.org/index.html), where many enthusiastic partners will participate in the discussion of problems.

In addition, if you have some insights in the learning process, you can write your own insights into an article, published in the forum for more developers to see, the forum's home page is as follows:
