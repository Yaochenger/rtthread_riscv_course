### Chapter Overview and Learning Objectives

This chapter introduces the RISC-V instruction set, RISC-V general-purpose registers, interrupt management, and RISC-V assembly, which are closely related to the content of Chapter 4, entitled 'Porting RT-Thread to RV32'. Furthermore, this chapter will introduce the reader to the RISC-V cores and development boards that are currently supported by RT-Thread.

The objective of this chapter is to equip the reader with the knowledge required to master the following:

- An understanding of the RISC-V instruction set, RISC-V general-purpose registers, RISC-V interrupt management methods and RISC-V assembly. Mastery of these contents will provide a solid foundation for porting RT-Thread to RV32.
- An awareness of the RT-Thread supported RISC-V cores and RISC-V development boards.
